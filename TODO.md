# TODO 

This is a list of things to do. First is a list of tasks in the order they 
will be implemented. Following that is a scratchpad of ideas and things that
might be useful. These will either get fleshed out and turned into tasks or 
discarded.

## Tasks

Here is what is planned, roughly in the order it will be implemented:

### Recently completed

A list of the last 10 tasks that were completed successfully. This does not
replace the CHANGELOG. Instead, it gives you an idea of what is new and how
active the project has been.

#### Add a filter based on observer/location (2023-10-30)

Added the ability to hide checklists for a selected location in the same 
way that observers are hidden. This is more effective than a filter list 
of observer/location pairs as a filter as nothing is hidden by default. 
There are still times when you want to view a checklist that would otherwise 
be hidden.
