# TODO 

This is a list of things to do. First is a list of tasks in the order they 
will be implemented. Following that is a scratchpad of ideas and things that
might be useful. These will either get fleshed out and turned into tasks or 
discarded.

## Tasks

Here is what is planned, roughly in the order it will be implemented:

## Ideas

### Add a filter based on observer/location

It's great to keep a garden list but it's generally not interesting to anybody
else. Same goes for a lot of patches (locations regularly visited by an observer
and very few others, if any). Add a list of Observer / Location pairs to filter 
out when a page is loaded. Again, the idea is to make the Recent Visits page 
quick to read. Filtering out low values / low interest checklists saves a lot 
of unnecessary clicking.
